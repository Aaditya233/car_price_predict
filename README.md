# 🚗 Car Price Prediction System 📊

Welcome to the **Car Price Prediction System**! This project leverages machine learning models to predict the price of a car based on its features, such as age, mileage, brand, and more. The system provides highly accurate predictions by using well-trained models and data-driven techniques.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The Car Price Prediction System helps users estimate the market price of a car based on various factors. By feeding in data like the car's brand, year, engine size, etc., the system can predict the resale value of a vehicle using machine learning.

### ✨ Features:
- **Multiple ML models** 🧠 including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
- **Data visualization** 📈 with graphs and plots to understand trends.
- **Interactive and easy-to-use interface** 🖥️ for quick car price predictions.
- **Preprocessing pipeline** 🧹 for data cleaning and feature engineering.
- **Comprehensive evaluation** 📊 of model performance using metrics like R² and RMSE.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python** 🐍
- **Pandas** for data manipulation 📊
- **Scikit-learn** for building and tuning ML models 🤖
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for data visualization 📉
- **NumPy** for numerical computations 🧮

## 📈 Data Visualization and Plots
This project includes various visualizations to help understand the data and model performance:

### 1. **Correlation Heatmap** 🔥
- Shows the relationship between different car features and prices.

```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
sns.heatmap(data.corr(), annot=True, cmap="coolwarm")
plt.title('Correlation Heatmap')
plt.show()
```

### 2. **Price Distribution** 💰
- Visualizes the distribution of car prices in the dataset.

```python
sns.histplot(data['price'], kde=True)
plt.title('Car Price Distribution')
plt.show()
```

### 3. **Feature Importance Plot** 📊
- Highlights the most important features for predicting car prices using models like Random Forest.

```python
importances = model.feature_importances_
sns.barplot(x=importances, y=features)
plt.title('Feature Importance')
plt.show()
```

## 📊 ML Models Used
We explored various models to predict car prices with maximum accuracy:
- **Linear Regression** 📏
- **Random Forest Regressor** 🌲
- **Gradient Boosting Regressor** 📈
